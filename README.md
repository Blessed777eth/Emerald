## 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 
### The Blockchain can be most closely compared to google cloud or Icloud in the sense that it stores data, however on the blockchain everything in open and data cannot be changed unless a transaction occurs or a smart contract has a function that allows data to be removed. The term Blockchain stems from the way the data is stored. On the Blockchain all data is collected in blocks and then chained together like a train with carts attached. The data is never ending and is transparent for anyone to see at any given moment.
