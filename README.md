## Chapter 1 Day 1 Quest

## 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 
 
 The Blockchain can be most closely compared to google cloud or Icloud in the sense that it stores data, however on the blockchain everything is open and data cannot be changed unless a transaction occurs or a smart contract has a function that allows data to be removed. The term Blockchain stems from the way the data is stored. On the Blockchain all data is collected in blocks and then chained together like a train with carts attached. The data is never ending and is transparent for anyone to see at any given moment. 

## 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.

 Smart contracts are programs deployed by developers to give functionatliy and access to users to interact with the blockchain. Think of Smart contracts like the laws of the blockchain except with smart contracts there is no need for politions, campaigning, or having to vote your bill into a law. Smart Contracts can be deployed instataneiously without any approval from anybody other than the developer. There is no paper work or third party involved, with this comes great risk and reward.
 
 ## 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
 
 A transaction is an interaction with the blockchain in which data is being altered and funds are being exchanged between parties. A script however is free and its main function is to view data on the blockchain. 

## Chapter 2 Day 1 Quest 

## 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

 1. Safety and Security 
 2. Clarity
 3. Approachability
 4. Developer Experience
 5. Resource Oriented Programming

## 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?

1. Safety and Security are an important and vital role in every aspect of our lives. From the way we use to the internet to the way we're able to provide for our families all of it stems by how effectively we're able to provide Safety and Security for those we're responsible for, in this sense it'd be the developers and users interacting with the Cadence program. People can rally behind something they trust and trust is built in part by providing Safety and Security, Which is a great pivot for the next pillar, 2. Clarity. It can be argued that without Clarity there is no Safety and Security. Im a firm believer that many of the worlds problems are misunderstandings/misconceptions which could be avoided if things were provided with a little more Clarity. Things should run smoothly for all parties involved and thats only possible if clarity is provided for all sides. Our next to pillars go hand in hand in my opinion, 3. Approachability and 4. Developer Experience, without the two how can you expect to reach the masses. Whether it be in our career, relationships, or in this case The Developer Experience things should be Approachable in the sense that the user doesnt run for the hills at the first sign of unfamiliarity. Change is constant and yet its one of the things us as humans fight the most. Being able to
