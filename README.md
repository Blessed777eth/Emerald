## Chapter 1 Day 1 Quest

## 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 
 
 The Blockchain can be most closely compared to google cloud or Icloud in the sense that it stores data, however on the blockchain everything in open and data cannot be changed unless a transaction occurs or a smart contract has a function that allows data to be removed. The term Blockchain stems from the way the data is stored. On the Blockchain all data is collected in blocks and then chained together like a train with carts attached. The data is never ending and is transparent for anyone to see at any given moment. 

## 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.

 Smart contracts are programs deployed by developers to give functionatliy and access to users to interact with the blockchain. Think of Smart contracts like the laws of the blockchain except with smart contracts theres no need for politions, campaigning, or having to vote your bill into a law. Smart Contracts can be deployed instataniously without any approval from anybody other than the developer. There is no paper work or third party involved, with this comes great risk and reward.
 
 ## 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
 
 A transaction is an interaction with the blockchain in which data is being altered and funds are being exchanged between parties. A script however is free and its main function is to view data on the blockchain.
